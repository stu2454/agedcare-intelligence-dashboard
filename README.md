## Overview

The Aged Care Sector Intelligence Dashboard is a data-driven regulatory intelligence tool designed to assist analysis of sector performance across Australia's aged care providers. Built using Streamlit and Plotly, this dashboard enables users to explore sector-wide trends and drill down into specific provider profiles using data from sources like the Aged Care Quality Data quarterly extracts.

It focuses on combining key regulatory metrics including:

*   Star Ratings (Overall, Compliance, Staffing, Quality Measures, Residents' Experience)
*   Compliance History (recorded compliance actions)
*   Residents' Experience survey breakdown
*   Staffing compliance relative to benchmark minutes
*   Quality Measures (pressure injuries, falls, restrictive practices, medication management, etc.)

The dashboard is designed to support regulatory oversight, market stewardship, and early identification of service risks.

## Features

### Sector Overview (Planned Finalisation)

*   High-level visualisation of sector performance by State, Territory, and Remoteness.
*   Average star ratings and quality indicators across the nation and by regions.

### Provider Drill-Down (Implemented)

*   Select a specific provider from a dynamic filter.
*   Summarised provider profile:
    *   Number of service suburbs operated
    *   Number of small, medium, and large services
*   Key compliance and quality metrics displayed:
    *   Overall Star Rating (average)
    *   Registered Nurse Care Compliance (% of required minutes)
    *   Total Care Minutes Compliance (%)
*   Average quality measures across services (bar chart with error bars showing standard error of the mean).
*   Distribution of quality indicators across services (box plot with individual service points; outliers highlighted in red).
*   **Compliance History Table:**
    *   Displays services with recorded compliance actions.
*   **Serious Concerns Alert:**
    *   Highlights any services with concerning indicators (e.g., Star Rating <= 2, poor compliance ratings).
    *   Services displayed with red background for easy visibility.
*   All numeric values formatted to one decimal place for professionalism.
*   Consistent, clean visual design optimised for stakeholder presentations.

## Technical Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
*   **Plotting Library:** [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
*   **Data Management:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
*   **Containerisation:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional for deployment)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your GitHub Username]/[New Repository Name].git
    cd [New Repository Name]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Data Requirements

*   This dashboard requires the **Star Ratings Quarterly Data Extract** Excel file.
*   The application currently expects the file named `star-ratings-quarterly-data-extract-february-2025.xlsx` to be present in the **same directory** as `app.py`.
*   **Note:** This data file is **not included** in the repository due to its size and potential sensitivity. You must obtain it separately.
    *   *(Suggestion for future: Consider adding functionality to upload the file via the Streamlit interface or configure the path).*

## Usage

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated and the required Excel data file is in place (see Data Requirements).
2.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (or the URL provided by Streamlit).

## Docker Deployment (Optional)

If you have Docker installed, you can build and run the dashboard in a container:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t agedcare-dashboard .
    ```

2.  **Run the container:**
    *   If port 8501 is available:
        ```bash
        # Make sure to mount or copy the data file into the container
        # Example (adjust path to your local data file):
        # docker run -p 8501:8501 -v /path/to/your/local/star-ratings-quarterly-data-extract-february-2025.xlsx:/app/star-ratings-quarterly-data-extract-february-2025.xlsx agedcare-dashboard

        # Simpler if Dockerfile copies it (modify Dockerfile needed):
        docker run -p 8501:8501 agedcare-dashboard
        ```
    *   If port 8501 is in use, map to a different port (e.g., 8510):
        ```bash
        # Adjust data mounting as above if needed
        docker run -p 8510:8501 agedcare-dashboard
        ```
    *   **Note:** The provided `Dockerfile` (if you create one) would need instructions (e.g., `COPY`) to include `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and potentially handle the data file, or you need to use volume mounts (`-v`) as shown above.

## Known Limitations

*   **Text-centering in tables:** Due to Streamlit's current `st.dataframe()` limitations, full centre-alignment of text and numbers within tables is not supported. Numbers are right-aligned, and text is left-aligned by default.
*   **Large datasets:** While the dashboard can handle national datasets (thousands of records), extremely large Excel files (>50MB) may lead to longer loading times or require more memory. Pre-processing might be beneficial for very large files.
*   **Hardcoded Data File Name:** The application currently expects a specific file name (`star-ratings-quarterly-data-extract-february-2025.xlsx`).

## Future Enhancements

*   Finalise sector-wide dashboard visualisation tabs.
*   Build dynamic serious-risk leaderboards.
*   Potential integration of GEM (Government Entry Management) or Sector Performance Reports automatically.
*   Add functionality to simulate predictive risk scores based on longitudinal trends.
*   Implement fine-grained filters (e.g., by compliance type, indicator thresholds).
*   Allow data file upload via the UI or configuration of the file path.
